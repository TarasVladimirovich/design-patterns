# Design Patterns are categorized mainly into three categories:

### Creational Design Pattern
  - **Abstract Factory** - It allows us to create objects without specifying their concrete type.
  - **Builder** - It is used to create the complex objects.
  - **Factory Method** - It allows us to create object without specifying the exact class to create.
  - **Prototype** - It is used to create a new object from the existing object.
  - **Singleton** - make sure that there is only one instance of an object is created.

### Structural Design Pattern
- **Adapter** - It provides us for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface
  around one of the existing classes.
- **Composite** - It wraps a group of objects into a single object.
- **Bridge** - It decouples an abstraction so that two classes can vary independently.
- **Decorator** - It extends the object behavior dynamically at the run time.
- **Facade** - It offers a simple interface to more complex underlying objects.
- **Flyweight** - It decreases the cost of complex object model.
- **Proxy** - It reduces the cost, reduce complexity, and provide the placeholder interface
  to an underlying object to control access.

### Behavioral Design Pattern
- **Chain of Responsibility** - It representatives the command to a chain of processing object.
- **Command** - It generates the objects which encapsulate actions of parameters.
- **Interpreter** - It implements a specialized language.
- **Iterator** - It accesses all the element of an object sequentially without violating its underlying representation.
- **Mediator** - It provides the loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed
          knowledge of their existing methods.
- **Memento** - It restores an object in the previous state.
- **Observer** - It allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
- **State** - It allows an object to modify its behavior when it's internal states changes.
- **Strategy** - It provides one of the families of algorithm to be selected at the runtime.
- **Template Method** - It allows the subclasses to provide concrete behavior. It also defines
          the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class.
- **Visitor** - It separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
